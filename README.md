# Challenge-4


## Setting up a quiz page for web designers
This page is supported by three main functions, namely multiple choices, a timer, and the previous score keeping. 


## Multiple Choices
This is the main section of the quiz page. 
When user clicks the "start" button, he/she is presented with multiple choice questions.
When an answer is selected, an indication shows up on the page suggesting whether the chosen answer is correct or wrong.
And with the selection of answer, the next question is presented to the user unless, either the question pool runs out of question, or the time-remaining reaches to 0.
With either of the above situation's occurrence, the user is taken to the "end of quiz" page where he/she is presented with a score, and is asked to enter initials.
Then user is free to clear the score record or/and re-start the quiz.


## Timer
The page is functioned with a build-in timer. 
It's executed when the "start" button is clicked, and then counts down from 75 seconds.
When a wrong answer is selected, the time-remaining subtracts by 15 seconds.
If the time remaining reaches 0, user is taken to "end of quiz" page.
If user completes the quiz before time runs out, timer function  disenables.
User's score is the time remaining shows on the timer.


## Keep score record
The page saves the last user's initial and score in the local storage.
User is free to clear the record by clicking "clear score" button, or access the record by clicking "highscore" - which is located on the top-left corner of the page.
